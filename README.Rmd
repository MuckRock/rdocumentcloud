The rdocumentcloud package is an R wrapper for the DocumentCloud API.

[Valid filetypes](https://www.documentcloud.org/help/tips#file-types-supported). 

A work in progress.

## Installation

You can install the development version of rdocumentcloud from [GitHub](https://github.com/MuckRock/rdocumentcloud).

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("MuckRock/rdocumentcloud")
```

## Usage

```{r}
library(rdocumentcloud)

#Function to do initial authentication with DocumentCloud API using username and password.
auth_response <- dc_auth('username@email.com', 'my_secret_password')

#Function to perform bulk upload of documents to DocumentCloud. Returns a dataframe
# of paths and destination urls. NOTE: must already be authenticated
upload_documents(file_names, 111111, unlist(auth_response$refresh))
```

<!--## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example} (this executes)
library(rdocumentcloud)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

 You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.-->
